Linear Regression:

y=f(x), where x is a independent variable, where as y is dependent variable, to know the relationship between the two input variables

y=a+bx,relation between x and y, if x value is known then y value can be predicted.

Measure of Good fit: Actual value and predicted value

The difference between actual and predicted value is called as Residual. 

Reduce the residual: Subtracting actual value by predictive value with whole square + all the remaining actual values -(minus) predictive value with whole square. 

Sum up the results of all the predicted lines. 

Compare all the result of the sum of the residual squares to know which is low valued result. 

Result with low value is the best line of fit.  

For practise, implement using Python/R
